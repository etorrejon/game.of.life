# Conway's Game of Life

First attempt at implementing Conway's Game of Life

Built using HTML5 canvas.

Tests written using [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/).

To run unit tests:

```
npm run test
```

To host using [http-server](https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server):

```
npm run httpserver
```

*(you'll need NodeJS if you want to run the tests or use http-server)*

To launch demo open src/index.html in your browser, or navigate to http://localhost:8080/ if using http-server.
