    <h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>

    <h2>Rules:</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Any live cell with less than two neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
      <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
      <li>Any live cell with more than three neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
      <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
    </ol>
